Speed up your builds with these tips:

1. Use dependency caching:
   - Render caches node_modules, pip cache, etc.
   - Only reinstalls changed dependencies

2. Optimize Docker builds:
   - Copy package files first
   - Run npm install before copying code
   - Use multi-stage builds

3. Reduce build artifacts:
   - Remove dev dependencies in production
   - Use .dockerignore or .gitignore
   - Avoid copying large files

4. Pre-build when possible:
   - Build locally and commit dist/
   - Use CI/CD for heavy builds
   - Skip build command if no build needed

Access logs for debugging and monitoring:

Types of logs:
- Application logs (stdout/stderr)
- Build logs
- System logs
- Deploy logs

View logs:
- Dashboard: Live tail in real-time
- CLI: render logs <service-name>
- API: Programmatic access

Log retention:
- Free: 7 days
- Paid: 30 days

Export logs to external services:
- Logfire
- Datadog
- Papertrail
- Logtail
- Custom HTTP endpoint

Best practices:
- Log to stdout/stderr
- Use structured logging (JSON)
- Include timestamps
- Don't log sensitive data
- Use log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

Securely manage secrets and credentials:

Environment variables:
- Encrypted at rest
- Encrypted in transit
- Not visible in logs
- Not exposed to preview environments (unless configured)

Best practices:
1. Never commit secrets to git
2. Use environment variables for API keys
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Use separate keys for different environments
5. Limit access to production secrets

Environment groups:
- Share secrets across services
- Update in one place
- Control access

For highly sensitive data:
- Use external secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Fetch secrets at runtime
- Use short-lived tokens

- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- HIPAA (on Team plans)
