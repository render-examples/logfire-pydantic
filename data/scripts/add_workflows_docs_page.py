## What Render Workflows Is

Render Workflows is an end-to-end orchestration and execution engine for
long-running, distributed tasks. Tasks execute across hundreds of concurrent
instances, with automatic queuing and provisioning managed by Render. It is the
recommended way to run AI agents on Render, alongside background jobs, ETL
pipelines, and batch processing.

## What's in a Workflow?

A workflow is built from **tasks**. A task is a standard TypeScript or Python
function registered with Render's SDK. Tasks can chain other tasks — or
themselves — and execute arbitrary logic, including AI agents that call LLMs and
fan out work.

## Defining Tasks

- Tasks are plain async functions plus a config object, registered with the
  Render Workflows SDK.
- The SDK is available for **TypeScript and Python** (more languages planned).
- The same SDK is used both to define tasks and to trigger runs from web apps,
  agents, or CI/CD systems.

## Execution Behavior

- **Timeouts** — each task run can execute for up to **24 hours**, customizable
  per task.
- **Retries** — if a task run fails, Render automatically retries it according
  to your settings.
- **Compute specs** — instance type is selectable per task for resource-intensive
  work.
- **Parallelism / fan-out** — a task can dispatch multiple concurrent runs and
  await their results. Render manages queuing if the workspace concurrency limit
  is exceeded.
- **Durability** — task execution is orchestrated and retried by the platform,
  so a crash doesn't lose in-flight work.

## Workflows vs. Job Queues

Workflows replaces hand-rolled job queues: the queue coordination, consumer
groups, acknowledgments, retries, and scaling you would otherwise build and
maintain become managed platform infrastructure.

## Deployment

A Workflow service pulls task definitions from a GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket
repository. Render builds the project into a custom image, caches it, and pushes
it to each task instance. You define your task functions, push to Git, and
Render runs them as a managed Workflow service with retries and tracing.

## Pricing

Render bills only for compute usage (prorated by the second) and, optionally,
for increasing your workspace's maximum number of concurrent task runs.

## Beta Limitations

During the beta, Workflows does not support: native scheduling (use a cron job
to trigger runs instead), Blueprints, HIPAA compliance, network-isolated
environments, or incoming network connections on runs.
