# The 7-Stage AI Pipeline

This document provides a detailed breakdown of each stage in the Q&A pipeline, including instrumentation patterns, costs, and performance characteristics.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline processes each question through seven stages in a single linear pass:

```
[1] Embedding → [2] Retrieval → [3] Generation → [4] Claims → 
[5] Verification → [6] Accuracy → [7] Evaluation
```

Conceptually the post-generation stages group into **three distinct verification capabilities**,
each answering a different question and demonstrating a different Workflows pattern:

| Capability | Stages | Question it answers |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Grounding** | [4] Claims Extraction → [5] Claims Verification | Is every factual statement supported by the retrieved sources? |
| **Accuracy** | [6] Technical Accuracy | Are there factual/technical errors? (surfaces errors + corrections) |
| **Quality** | [7] Dual-Model Evaluation | How well does the answer serve the developer, and do two independent judges agree? |

These are deliberately *not* redundant: Grounding checks claims against sources, Accuracy owns
factual correctness, and Quality owns the developer experience (clarity, completeness, usefulness).

Answer generation ([3]) is **neutral**: the assistant answers only from the retrieved context with
no product-favorable steering in the prompt. Render-specific docs reach the model through retrieval
and the curated-injection rules in [`retrieval.py`](../backend/pipeline/retrieval.py), not by being
hard-coded into the generation instructions.

The stage logic below lives in [`backend/pipeline/`](../backend/pipeline/).
In production it executes as a **Render Workflows** run: the `run_qa_pipeline` orchestrator
([`workflows/app.py`](../workflows/app.py)) keeps the cheap stages (1, 2) in-process and
promotes the heavy LLM stages (3, 4, 5) to their own retried subtasks, with stages 6 + 7
running as three concurrent subtasks on separate instances. See the
[Architecture section of the README](../README.md#architecture) for the topology.

## Stage 1: Question Embedding

**Purpose:** Convert natural language question to vector representation

**Model:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`

**Cost:** ~$0.002 per question

**Instrumentation:**

```python
@logfire.instrument("embed_question")
async def embed_question(text: str) -> List[float]:
    with logfire.span("openai_embedding") as span:
        span.set_attribute("text_length", len(text))
        embedding = await openai.embeddings.create(...)
        span.set_attribute("cost_usd", calculate_cost(...))
        return embedding
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~100ms
- Cost per embedding: $0.0002
- Embedding dimensions: 1536

---

## Stage 2: RAG Document Retrieval (Hybrid Search)

**Purpose:** Find relevant documentation chunks using hybrid search

**Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension + full-text search

**Method:** Hybrid Search combining semantic (vector) + lexical (BM25) search

**Ranking:** Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to merge results

### Why Hybrid Search?

Pure semantic search can miss documents with specific keywords (e.g., "15 minutes", "port 3000"). Hybrid search combines:

- **Semantic search (60%)** - Understanding intent and context
- **BM25 lexical search (40%)** - Exact keyword and phrase matching

### How it Works

1. Run vector similarity search (pgvector) for semantic matches
2. Run full-text search (PostgreSQL `tsvector`) for keyword matches
3. Combine rankings using RRF: `score = 1/(k + rank)` where k=60
4. Return top documents sorted by combined score

### Instrumentation

```python
@logfire.instrument("rag_retrieval")
async def retrieve_documents(embedding: List[float], query_text: str) -> List[Document]:
    with logfire.span("hybrid_search") as span:
        docs = await vectorstore.hybrid_search(
            query_text=query_text,
            query_embedding=embedding,
            k=10,
            bm25_weight=0.4  # 60% semantic, 40% BM25
        )
        span.set_attribute("docs_found", len(docs))
        span.set_attribute("semantic_count", semantic_results)
        span.set_attribute("bm25_count", bm25_results)
        return docs
```

**Performance:** Hybrid search increases retrieval accuracy by ~35% for queries with specific numbers, technical terms, or product names.

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~300ms
- Documents retrieved: 10 (configurable)
- Cost: ~$0.0001 per retrieval

## Stage 3: Answer Generation

**Purpose:** Generate a comprehensive answer **neutrally** from the retrieved context — the prompt contains only grounding rules (use the context, don't invent, don't conflate product types), with no product-favorable steering

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6

**Context:** RAG documents + conversation history

**Max Tokens:** 2000 (optimized for cost)

**Instrumentation:**

```python
@logfire.instrument("generate_answer")
async def generate_answer(question: str, context: str) -> dict:
    with logfire.span("claude_generation") as span:
        response = await anthropic.messages.create(...)
        span.set_attribute("input_tokens", response.usage.input_tokens)
        span.set_attribute("output_tokens", response.usage.output_tokens)
        span.set_attribute("cost_usd", calculate_anthropic_cost(...))
        return {"answer": response.content[0].text, "cost": cost}
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~2.1s
- Cost per generation: ~$0.045 (most expensive stage)
- Average output tokens: ~800

---

## Stage 4: Claims Extraction

**Capability:** Grounding (Stage 4 → Stage 5) — is every factual statement supported by the retrieved sources?

**Purpose:** Extract verifiable factual claims from generated answer

**Model:** GPT-4o-mini (fast + cheap)

**Output:** JSON list of claims

**Example Claims:**
- "Render supports Node.js versions 14, 16, 18, and 20"
- "PostgreSQL databases include automated daily backups"
- "Static sites deploy automatically on git push"

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~400ms
- Cost per extraction: ~$0.008
- Average claims per answer: 5-8

---

## Stage 5: Claims Verification

**Purpose:** Verify each claim against documentation

**Method:** RAG search for each claim's embedding

**Threshold:** 0.85 similarity score

**Output:** Verified vs unverified claims

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~500ms
- Cost per verification: ~$0.0015
- Verification accuracy: ~92%

---

## Stage 6: Technical Accuracy Check

**Capability:** Accuracy — owns *factual correctness*

**Purpose:** Deep factual-grounding validation using Claude. Judges only whether the answer is correct and grounded (not its style or completeness — that is Stage 7's job); surfaces errors + corrections for observability

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6

**Input:** Original answer + claims + verification results

**Output:** Accuracy score (0-100) + corrections needed

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~600ms
- Cost per check: ~$0.018
- Average accuracy score: 89/100

---

## Stage 7: Quality Rating (Dual-Model Evaluation)

**Capability:** Quality — owns the *developer experience*

**Purpose:** Independent quality assessment (clarity, completeness, usefulness) from two models running in parallel; factual verification is left to Stage 6, and the two judges' agreement is a confidence signal

**Models:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini + Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6

**Criteria:**
- Technical accuracy (30%)
- Clarity & organization (25%)
- Completeness (25%)
- Developer value (20%)

**Output:**

```json
{
  "openai_score": 92,
  "anthropic_score": 88,
  "average_score": 90,
  "agreement_level": "high",
  "feedback": "..."
}
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Average latency: ~300ms
- Cost per evaluation: ~$0.007
- Inter-rater agreement: 77% (within 10 points)

## Optimization Tips

### Reducing Costs

1. **Lower MAX_TOKENS** - Reduce output token limit for generation
2. **Use smaller models** - Consider GPT-4o-mini for less critical stages
3. **Cache frequent questions** - Store common Q&A pairs

### Improving Quality

1. **Improve RAG context** - Add more documentation, refine chunking
2. **Tune prompts** - Iterate on generation and evaluation prompts
3. **Increase MAX_TOKENS** - Allow more detailed answers for complex questions
4. **Add examples** - Few-shot examples in prompts

### Reducing Latency

1. **Parallelize stages** - Run independent evaluators concurrently
2. **Optimize retrieval** - Fine-tune hybrid search weights and top-k
3. **Use streaming** - Stream responses to users as they're generated
4. **Cache embeddings** - Store question embeddings for common queries
